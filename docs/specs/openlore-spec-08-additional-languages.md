# OpenLore Spec 08 — Additional General-Purpose Languages (C#, Kotlin, PHP, C, Scala, Dart, Lua, Elixir, Bash)

> A Claude Code prompt. Paste into a fresh session opened at the OpenLore repo root.

## Context for you (the agent)

OpenLore is graph-native: it models a codebase as functions (nodes) and calls (edges), then serves orientation questions over that graph — `orient`, `search_code`, `get_subgraph`, `analyze_impact`, `trace_execution_path`, `suggest_insertion_points`. The whole product rests on one extraction stage: per file, a tree-sitter grammar parses the source, a `*_FN_QUERY` extracts function/method declarations into `FunctionNode`s, and a `*_CALL_QUERY` extracts call sites into `CallEdge`s. Everything downstream — search index, SCIP export (spec-04), federation manifest (spec-05), MCP tools — consumes that one graph.

Today OpenLore extracts call graphs for **nine** general-purpose languages: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Ruby, Java, C++, and Swift. Spec-07 added Infrastructure-as-Code on top of the same primitives.

This spec closes the most painful remaining gaps in **general-purpose** coverage. The gaps fall into two buckets, and you must understand the difference before writing a line:

1. **Phantom languages — detected but dropped.** `detectLanguage` ([src/core/analyzer/signature-extractor.ts:39](../../src/core/analyzer/signature-extractor.ts#L39)) already returns `Kotlin` for `.kt`, `PHP` for `.php`, `C#` for `.cs`, and `C` for `.c`. But [call-graph.ts](../../src/core/analyzer/call-graph.ts) loads no grammar for any of them and the per-language dispatch ([call-graph.ts:389-489](../../src/core/analyzer/call-graph.ts#L389)) has no branch for them, so every one of these files is parsed into **nothing**. A user with a C# or Kotlin or PHP repo runs `openlore analyze`, sees files counted, and gets an empty graph for them. This is worse than "unsupported" — it is silently, confidently wrong. **Note also:** `C` is detected but even C++'s grammar is not invoked for it (the dispatch at [call-graph.ts:425](../../src/core/analyzer/call-graph.ts#L425) lists `C++` only). Closing this bucket is the highest-value, lowest-risk work in the spec.

2. **New languages — not detected at all.** Scala, Dart, Lua, Elixir, and Bash/Shell return `unknown` from `detectLanguage` and are dropped at detection time. These are the next tier of "popular and call-graph-shaped" languages with mature tree-sitter grammars.

### Why these languages, and why these only

The selection criterion is deliberate and you should hold the line on it: **a language is in scope iff (a) it is widely used, (b) it has a mature, npm-installable tree-sitter grammar consistent with the existing nine, and (c) its programs are genuinely call-graph-shaped** (functions/methods that call other functions/methods — the thing OpenLore's node/edge model expresses). The nine languages below all pass. Languages that fail criterion (c) — SQL (set logic, not call graphs), R and MATLAB (interactive/vectorized data work with weak intra-project call structure), HTML/CSS (not executable) — are **out of scope** no matter how popular. Languages that fail (a) or (b) for now — Objective-C, Perl, Haskell, Clojure, F#, Groovy, OCaml, Zig, Nim, Julia, Erlang, Visual Basic — are **deferred** (see "Out of scope"). Do not silently expand the set; if you believe one of the deferred languages belongs in this PR, say so in the PR description and leave it deferred unless told otherwise.

The nine **in scope** for this one PR:

| Language | Extensions | Bucket | Grammar package | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **C#** | `.cs` | phantom (detected, dropped) | `tree-sitter-c-sharp` | Huge .NET ecosystem; methods, classes, namespaces. |
| **Kotlin** | `.kt`, `.kts` | phantom | `tree-sitter-kotlin` | Android/JVM; functions, classes, extension functions. |
| **PHP** | `.php`, `.phtml` | phantom | `tree-sitter-php` | Web; functions, methods, `$this->m()`, `Class::m()`. |
| **C** | `.c`, `.h` | phantom (detected, no dispatch) | `tree-sitter-c` | Functions + calls. Note `.h` collision with C++ (below). |
| **Scala** | `.scala`, `.sc` | new | `tree-sitter-scala` | JVM; `def`, `object`, `class`, `trait`. |
| **Dart** | `.dart` | new | `tree-sitter-dart` | Flutter; functions, methods, classes. |
| **Lua** | `.lua` | new | `tree-sitter-lua` | Scripting/embedding; `function`, `local function`, table methods. |
| **Elixir** | `.ex`, `.exs` | new | `tree-sitter-elixir` | BEAM; `def`/`defp` inside `defmodule`, `Mod.fun()` calls. |
| **Bash/Shell** | `.sh`, `.bash` | new | `tree-sitter-bash` | Function definitions and function-name call sites. |

This is the decision to record before writing code (see `record_decision`): *additional general-purpose language support is added by following the existing tree-sitter extractor pattern exactly — one lazy grammar loader, one `*_FN_QUERY`, one `*_CALL_QUERY`, one dispatch branch per language — with no change to the graph schema, the MCP tools, or `orient`. Phantom languages (detected but never parsed) are the priority; closing them is a bug fix as much as a feature.*

## Scope contract — do not break these things

This PR must NOT:

- Change the `FunctionNode` / `CallEdge` / `ClassNode` schema, the MCP tools, `orient`, the search index, SCIP export, or the federation manifest. New languages ride entirely on the existing primitives and the existing extraction pipeline.
- Regress any of the existing nine languages. Their grammars, queries, dispatch, and **byte-identical graph output** on unchanged inputs must be preserved. Lock this with the existing test suite plus a snapshot of the OpenLore repo's own graph before/after.
- Attempt semantic resolution beyond what the existing extractors do. OpenLore's call edges are **name-based and best-effort** (it matches callee names to declared functions, with confidence; it does not do full type resolution or overload resolution). New languages match that bar exactly — do not build a type checker. Where a call target is genuinely unresolvable statically (dynamic dispatch, reflection, `eval`, computed method names), emit **no edge** rather than a wrong one, and leave a `TODO(spec-08-followup): …`.
- Require any external toolchain (`dotnet`, `kotlinc`, `php`, `gcc`, `scalac`, `dart`, `lua`, `mix`, `bash`) at analyze time. Static parsing only.
- Add grammars that don't build cleanly across the CI platforms the existing grammars build on. Each tree-sitter grammar is a **native module**; if a grammar fails to build or install on a supported platform, that language must degrade gracefully (see "Graceful degradation") — never crash `analyze`.

This PR must:

- Add call-graph extraction for **all nine** languages above in **one PR**.
- Fix the phantom-language bug as part of this work: C#, Kotlin, PHP, and C must go from "counted but empty graph" to "real nodes and edges."
- Make each language **discoverable end to end**: extensions mapped by `detectLanguage`, files walked, parsed into nodes+edges, merged into the graph, indexed for search, and surfaced by every MCP tool with **zero tool-side changes**.
- Be deterministic: re-analyzing an unchanged tree produces an identical graph (stable node ids, sorted edges) for every new language.
- Keep `call-graph.ts` maintainable. It is a high-fan-in hub ([CallGraphBuilder.build](../../src/core/analyzer/call-graph.ts) has fanOut 49 per the codebase digest). Follow the existing in-file pattern (lazy loader + query constants + extractor function + dispatch branch) so the change reads like the surrounding code; do **not** refactor the existing language handlers while you are here.

## The extractor pattern you must follow (read this before coding)

Every existing language is wired in exactly four places. Replicate this for each new language; deviating from it is the most likely way to introduce a regression.

1. **Lazy grammar loader** ([call-graph.ts:255-341](../../src/core/analyzer/call-graph.ts#L255)). A module-level `let _XxxLanguage: object | undefined;` plus a `getXxxParser()` that dynamic-`import()`s the grammar once, calls `setLanguage`, and caches the parser. Match the existing shape exactly, including the `(module.default as …)` unwrapping each grammar needs (TypeScript's is `.typescript`; most others are `.default`; **verify each grammar's actual export shape** — they differ, and getting this wrong yields a runtime crash, not a type error).

2. **Detection** (`detectLanguage`, [signature-extractor.ts:39](../../src/core/analyzer/signature-extractor.ts#L39)). For the new languages, add the extension cases. For the phantom languages the case already exists — do **not** duplicate it. Handle the `.h` ambiguity explicitly (see below).

3. **Query constants.** Two tree-sitter queries per language, named `<LANG>_FN_QUERY` (captures function/method/class declarations with their names and `@name`/`@body` nodes for line ranges) and `<LANG>_CALL_QUERY` (captures call expressions and the callee identifier). Model these on the closest existing language: C# / Kotlin / Scala / Dart → study the **Java** and **TypeScript** queries (class-with-methods, `obj.method()`); C → study **C++** (C is a subset; the C++ query may largely transfer); PHP → **Java**/**Ruby** hybrid (`$this->m()`, `Class::m()`, free functions); Lua → **Python**-like (functions + table-method `t.f()` / `t:m()`); Elixir → **Ruby**-like (`defmodule`/`def`, `Mod.fun()`); Bash → simplest (function definitions; calls are bare command words matching a defined function name).

4. **Dispatch branch** ([call-graph.ts:389-489](../../src/core/analyzer/call-graph.ts#L389)). Add `if (language === 'C#') { … }` etc., calling a per-language `extractXxx(...)` that runs the two queries and returns `{ functions, calls, classes }` in the same shape every existing extractor returns. Where a new language is structurally identical to an existing one, you **may** route it through a shared generic extractor (e.g. the Java-style class/method extractor) parameterized by the query constants — but only if it does not perturb the existing language's output. When in doubt, copy rather than abstract; this file values locality.

### The `.h` problem (must handle explicitly)

`.h` headers are claimed by **both** C and C++ (`detectLanguage` currently returns `C++` for `.h`). Do not regress C++ projects. Resolution rule, in order:
- A `.h` in a project that contains any `.cpp`/`.cc`/`.cxx` → treat as **C++** (current behavior; keep it).
- A `.h` in a project with `.c` files and no C++ files → treat as **C**.
- Ambiguous / standalone `.h` → default to **C++** (status quo; C++ grammar is a superset and parses C headers acceptably).
Implement this as a small, tested heuristic. Because the C++ grammar is a superset, misclassifying a C header as C++ is low-harm; the reverse (a C++ header as C) loses templates/namespaces, so bias toward C++. Document the rule in `docs/languages.md`.

## Per-language deliverables and gotchas

Implement in this order. The phantom languages first (they are bug fixes and the highest value); then the new languages.

### Phantom-language fixes (priority 1)

1. **C#** — `namespace`/`class`/`struct`/`record`/`interface` → grouping (`ClassNode`); `method`/`constructor`/`local function`/property accessors → `FunctionNode`. Calls: `obj.Method()`, `Class.StaticMethod()`, `this.M()`, `base.M()`. Gotchas: top-level statements (C# 9+, methods at file scope); partial classes (one logical class across files — link members, don't duplicate the class); LINQ method chains; `async`/`await`; expression-bodied members (`=> expr`).

2. **Kotlin** — `fun` (top-level, member, **extension** functions), `class`/`object`/`interface`/`data class`/`companion object` → grouping; `obj.m()`, `Class.m()`, top-level function calls. Gotchas: extension functions (`fun Foo.bar()` — name is `bar`, receiver is `Foo`; record receiver in `className`/signature, don't drop it); lambdas with trailing-lambda syntax; `companion object` members; default args.

3. **PHP** — `function` (free), `class`/`trait`/`interface`/`enum` with methods → grouping; calls: free `foo()`, `$this->m()`, `$obj->m()`, `Class::staticM()`, `self::m()`, `parent::m()`. Gotchas: PHP files mixing HTML and `<?php … ?>` (the grammar handles the islands — parse only PHP regions); namespaces (`\App\Foo`); variable functions (`$fn()` — unresolvable, drop); magic methods.

4. **C** — `function_definition` → `FunctionNode`; `call_expression` → edges. No classes (use file/translation-unit as the implicit grouping; do **not** invent classes). Gotchas: macros that look like calls (best-effort; `#define`d function-like macros are not reliably resolvable — drop unresolved); function pointers (`(*fp)()` — drop); K&R-style decls (rare; tolerate). Wire C through the dispatch and the `.h` heuristic above.

### New languages (priority 2)

5. **Scala** — `def` (methods/functions), `object`/`class`/`trait`/`case class` → grouping; calls `obj.m()`, `Obj.m()`, infix/operator methods (extract the common `a.m(b)` form; infix `a m b` is lower priority — `TODO(spec-08-followup)` if it balloons). Gotchas: implicit/given; for-comprehensions desugaring (ignore — parse surface calls); package objects.

6. **Dart** — top-level functions, `class`/`mixin`/`extension`/`enum` methods, constructors (incl. named `Foo.named()`); calls `obj.m()`, `Class.m()`, top-level `f()`. Gotchas: named/optional params; cascades (`..m()` — resolve the method name); async/`Future`; widget `build()` trees (just calls — fine).

7. **Lua** — `function name() … end`, `local function`, `function t.f()` / `function t:m()` (the `:` form has implicit `self`); calls `f()`, `t.f()`, `t:m()`. Gotchas: everything is a table (no real classes — model `t.f`/`t:m` by their table name in `className`, best-effort); functions assigned to fields (`t.f = function() end`); metatables/OO frameworks (drop what you can't resolve).

8. **Elixir** — `defmodule` → grouping (`ClassNode`), `def`/`defp`/`defmacro` → `FunctionNode`; calls: local `fun(args)`, remote `Mod.fun(args)`, piped `arg |> fun()`. Gotchas: arity matters in Elixir (`fun/2`) — include arity in the signature and, where cheap, in name disambiguation; pattern-matched multi-clause functions (multiple `def foo` with different heads → one logical node, note clause count in signature, do not emit N duplicate nodes); macros that generate functions (unresolvable — drop).

9. **Bash/Shell** — `function f { … }` / `f() { … }` → `FunctionNode`; calls = command words that match a **defined** function name within the project (do not emit edges to external binaries like `ls`/`grep` — those are not project functions; treat them as external/ignored, consistent with how `isIgnoredCallee` filters builtins elsewhere). Gotchas: subshells, `source`/`.` of other scripts (a `source other.sh` could be modeled as a file-level dependency — optional, `TODO(spec-08-followup)`); dynamic command names (drop); aliases.

## Discovery: detection, walker, grammars

- **`detectLanguage`** ([signature-extractor.ts:39](../../src/core/analyzer/signature-extractor.ts#L39)): add `.kts`→Kotlin, `.phtml`→PHP, `.scala`/`.sc`→Scala, `.dart`→Dart, `.lua`→Lua, `.ex`/`.exs`→Elixir, `.sh`/`.bash`→Bash. `.kt`/`.php`/`.cs`/`.c` already map — leave them. Apply the `.h` heuristic. Update the `FileSignatureMap.language` doc comment ([signature-extractor.ts](../../src/core/analyzer/signature-extractor.ts)) which currently enumerates the old language set.
- **File walker** ([src/core/analyzer/file-walker.ts](../../src/core/analyzer/file-walker.ts)) is deny-list based, so these extensions are already walked. Confirm none are excluded; do not remove existing excludes.
- **Grammars** (`package.json`): add the nine grammar packages (or the subset that have stable releases — see degradation). Pin versions consistent with the existing `^0.23.x`/`^0.24.x` range where available. These are **native modules**; the PR body must list each grammar, its install size, and whether it prebuilds or compiles from source (exactly as spec-04 justified `protobufjs` and spec-07 justified `tree-sitter-hcl`).
- **Signatures/search:** the regex-based Stage-1 signature extractors in `signature-extractor.ts` (used for search before/independent of the call graph) currently cover a subset of languages. Extend the signature extraction for the new languages **best-effort** so they are searchable via BM25 (spec-06) even when a grammar fails to load; if full signature regexes per language balloon scope, ship the call-graph extraction (which already feeds search) and leave `TODO(spec-08-followup): Stage-1 regex signatures for <lang>`.

### Graceful degradation (required)

Native grammar modules can fail to install/build on some platforms. Each new language's `getXxxParser()` must fail **soft**: wrap the dynamic import in the same defensive pattern the codebase uses, and if the grammar is unavailable, log one clear warning (`language <X> grammar unavailable — files will be indexed for search but not graphed`) and skip graph extraction for that language **without aborting `analyze` or any other language**. A missing grammar must never throw out of `CallGraphBuilder.build`. Add a test that simulates an unavailable grammar and asserts analyze completes and other languages are unaffected.

```

## Acceptance criteria

1. **Phantom bug fixed.** On a fixture repo containing C#, Kotlin, PHP, and C files, `openlore analyze` produces non-empty nodes **and** edges for each (today it produces zero). Assert exact node/edge counts against small fixtures. A regression test guards that these four never silently return an empty graph again.
2. **New languages graphed.** For each of Scala, Dart, Lua, Elixir, and Bash, a fixture with two functions where one calls the other yields exactly two `FunctionNode`s and one `CallEdge` with the correct direction (caller → callee). Lock exact counts.
3. **Class/grouping.** For the languages with grouping constructs (C#, Kotlin, PHP, Scala, Dart, Elixir), a fixture with a class/object/module containing two methods yields one `ClassNode` whose `methodIds` reference both method `FunctionNode`s.
4. **Language-specific edges resolve.** Targeted fixtures prove: C# `Class.StaticMethod()` and `this.M()`; Kotlin extension-function call; PHP `$this->m()`, `Class::m()`, free `foo()`; Elixir `Mod.fun()` and local `fun()`; Lua `t:m()` and `t.f()`; Bash defined-function call (and **no** edge to `grep`/`ls`).
5. **`.h` disambiguation.** A C-only project's `.h` → `C`; a project with `.cpp` present → its `.h` stays `C++`. Both assert correctly; no C++ project regresses.
6. **Cross-cutting tools unchanged.** `orient`, `search_code`, `get_subgraph`, `analyze_impact`, and `trace_execution_path` return nodes/edges for every new language with **zero changes** to those tools (assert in an integration test on a polyglot fixture spanning at least three of the new languages). The spec-05 manifest `languages[]` includes the new tags; the spec-04 SCIP export emits the new-language nodes without error (mapping any language with no SCIP `Language` enum value to `UnspecifiedLanguage`, already handled by `scipLanguageName`).
7. **Graceful degradation.** With a grammar made unavailable (simulated), `analyze` completes, emits the documented warning, indexes that language's files for search, and produces full graphs for all other languages.
8. **Determinism.** Re-analyzing an unchanged tree yields an identical graph (stable ids, sorted edges) for every new language.
9. **No regression.** The full existing suite passes; a before/after graph snapshot of the OpenLore repo itself (which is TypeScript) is byte-identical; the existing nine languages' fixtures are unchanged.
10. `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:run`, `npm run build` all pass. The PR body justifies each added native grammar dependency (size, prebuild vs. source compile, platform support) exactly as spec-04 and spec-07 did.

## Detection heuristics — be conservative

- Emit a call edge **only** when the callee resolves to a function declared in the project (matching the existing name-based, confidence-scored approach). Dynamic dispatch, reflection, `eval`, variable/computed method names, macro-generated functions → **no edge**; leave `TODO(spec-08-followup): dynamic call resolution for <lang>`.
- Never invent grouping constructs a language doesn't have (C, Lua, Bash have no classes — do not synthesize them; use file scope).
- Multi-clause / overloaded / partial definitions (Elixir multi-clause, C# partial classes, PHP/whatever overloads) collapse to **one logical node** per name+container, with clause/overload count noted in the signature — never N duplicate nodes for the same logical function.
- When a grammar's export shape or query syntax is uncertain, write a tiny throwaway probe against one fixture to confirm node types **before** writing the full query. Tree-sitter node-type names differ per grammar; guessing them wastes a full debug cycle.

## Out of scope for this PR (deferred languages / non-call-graph)

Ship the nine above in this one PR. Explicitly deferred to future specs — do **not** start them here, but leave `TODO(spec-08-followup): <name>` where a natural extension point exists:

- **Deferred general-purpose** (popular but lower priority / less mature grammar / declining): **Objective-C**, **Perl**, **Haskell**, **Clojure**, **F#**, **Groovy**, **OCaml**, **Zig**, **Nim**, **Julia**, **Erlang**, **Visual Basic / VB.NET**, **PowerShell**, **Fortran**, **COBOL**.
- **Out of scope by design** (not call-graph-shaped — these need a *different* model, not this extractor pattern): **SQL** (query/DDL — a schema-and-reference graph, a separate spec like spec-07's IaC), **R** / **MATLAB** (vectorized interactive analysis, weak intra-project call structure), **HTML/CSS/templating** (not executable control flow), **Markdown/JSON/YAML config** (data, not code — except where spec-07 already claims it as IaC).
- **Assembly**, **WebAssembly text (WAT)**: out of scope.

(You may be tempted to fold one more "easy" language in because the pattern is mechanical. Resist it — nine languages, including four phantom-bug fixes, is a full PR. Adding more raises the native-dependency surface and the regression risk for every existing language without proportional value.)

## Test plan

- **Per-language unit tests**, co-located, small fixtures under `src/core/analyzer/fixtures/<lang>/`. For each language: parse the fixture, assert exact `FunctionNode`s, `ClassNode`s (where applicable), and `CallEdge`s with correct direction. Lock counts once computed (small fixtures, like spec-04/07).
- **Phantom-regression tests** — explicit tests that C#, Kotlin, PHP, and C produce **non-empty** graphs (the precise failure mode this spec fixes).
- **`.h` heuristic test** — table-driven across the three cases.
- **Graceful-degradation test** — simulate an unavailable grammar; assert `analyze` completes and other languages are unaffected.
- **Polyglot integration test** — one fixture mixing app code in ≥3 new languages plus an existing language; assert `orient`/`get_subgraph` surface nodes across all of them and at least one cross-language-irrelevant intra-language edge resolves; proves the projection rides the existing tools unchanged.
- **Determinism test** — build twice per language, deep-equal the serialized graph.
- **No-regression snapshot** — snapshot the OpenLore repo's own graph before and after; assert byte-identical (the repo is TypeScript, so any diff means you perturbed an existing path).
- **Regression** — full existing suite stays green.

## Git workflow — read carefully

1. Branch: `openlore-spec-08-additional-languages` off the default branch.
2. **Open exactly ONE pull request** titled `spec-08: additional general-purpose language support (C#, Kotlin, PHP, C, Scala, Dart, Lua, Elixir, Bash)` for **ALL** of this work — all nine languages, the phantom-bug fix, the `.h` heuristic, graceful degradation, discovery, docs, and tests. **Every commit for this spec — every language, every fix, every follow-up revision, every reviewer-requested change — pushes to that single PR and that single branch. Never open a second PR under any circumstances.** If the design changes mid-flight, push more commits to the same branch. If a reviewer requests changes, push more commits to the same branch. If you split the work across sessions, resume on the same branch and the same PR.
3. Land it incrementally **within that one PR**. A reasonable commit sequence: (a) detection + `.h` heuristic + graceful-degradation scaffold + the shared dispatch plumbing; (b) C#; (c) Kotlin; (d) PHP; (e) C; (f) Scala; (g) Dart; (h) Lua; (i) Elixir; (j) Bash; (k) docs + README + polyglot integration test. Each commit keeps `lint`/`typecheck`/`test:run`/`build` green.
4. Record the architectural decision (additional languages follow the existing tree-sitter extractor pattern; no schema/MCP/tool changes; phantom languages are the priority) via `record_decision` **before** writing code, per the repo's decision-gate workflow.
5. If a single language's edge resolution balloons scope, ship its **nodes** plus the edges you can resolve cleanly and leave precise `TODO(spec-08-followup): …` markers — but still ship all nine languages' detection and node extraction in this PR. Do not split a language across PRs, and do not drop the phantom-bug fix.
6. Run `lint`, `typecheck`, `test:run`, `build` before every push.
