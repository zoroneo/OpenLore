## Why

OpenLore's true north is to be the **persistent memory and context layer that feeds AI agents useful
data so they do less labor, spend fewer tokens, and develop faster**. Everything we ship is judged
against that.

OpenLore *already* governs agents through one channel: EpistemicLease tracks per-agent behavioral
state and injects a freshness/staleness signal into every MCP tool response
(`getFreshnessSignal(tracker)` in `mcp.ts`). "Your index is stale, re-orient" is a nudge we already
emit, and it already rides on the `EpistemicTracker`. PR #83's Panic Response Layer is built on the
**same** `EpistemicTracker` and injects through the **same** content-item surface. So this is an
*extension of governance we already do*, not a pivot to a new product.

The distinction that matters: a freshness signal is a **fact** (the index commit moved), cheap to
trust. A panic signal is a **judgment** ("you appear to be thrashing"), and a wrong judgment is
negative value — it spends the tokens we exist to save and interrupts good work. Therefore the layer
earns its place **only if the signal is accurate**, and accuracy is something we must validate before
we ever let it intervene by default.

This change adopts the work in a way that keeps that discipline: land the deterministic behavioral
*observability* core (default **off**, zero overhead when off), and gate every *interventional* and
heavy-infrastructure part behind opt-in modes and follow-up PRs that must prove their value.

## What this is NOT (scope guardrails)

- **No LLM inference.** The entire layer is deterministic runtime heuristics — Shannon entropy over
  command signatures, oscillation over the module-transition sequence, hysteresis thresholds, wall-clock
  decay. There are zero model calls. The north-star determinism constraint (`c6d1ad07`) holds.
- **No new default surface.** `panicResponse.mode` defaults to `off`. When off: no scoring, no state
  file, no injection, no telemetry, no background process. Existing users are unaffected.
- **Not a pivot.** It extends the existing EpistemicLease nudge channel; it does not add a new domain,
  a new tool to the default/minimal MCP surface, or a security/threat-modeling product.

## What changes (the core that lands now)

1. **Behavioral signals on `EpistemicTracker`.** `panicScore`, `panicLevel` (L0–L4 with hysteresis),
   `localityConfidence` (shared with the freshness burst gate), and supporting fields. Computed by
   `updatePanic()`, extracted from `updateTracker()` and called **conditionally** on panic mode.
   `updateTracker()` (the freshness engine, now V4 on `main`) always runs unchanged.

2. **`panic-response.ts` + `panic-constants.ts`.** The hysteresis engine, atomic `panic-state.json`
   I/O (fail-open reads, POSIX rename writes), and a single source of truth for every threshold/weight.

3. **Opt-in mode ladder, default `off`.** `off | observe | advisory`. `observe` = scoring + state file,
   no agent impact (this is the mode we validate accuracy on). `advisory` = + a signal injected as a
   separate content item at L2+ (never concatenated into the result body, so JSON/patches stay intact).

4. **`openlore panic-check`** — the PreToolUse hook consumer. Reads state, applies cooldown,
   **always exits 0** (fail-open). Not auto-installed; the user wires it up explicitly.

5. **`openlore panic-level`** — read-only status-line output (`P:L{n}`), no writes, no side effects.

6. **Telemetry.** A `panic` domain (`panic.jsonl`) with provenance-tagged `panic_score_delta` and
   level-change events, and a panic section in `openlore telemetry`. Telemetry writes go through the
   **existing `redactSecrets()` path** (mcp-security: Secret Confinement) — the rotation logic this PR
   adds is combined with redaction, never replacing it.

## What is deferred to follow-up PRs (must prove value before landing)

These are the parts that carry real cost, external dependencies, or unproven intervention. They do
**not** land in this change.

| Deferred item | Why it waits |
|---|---|
| **`experimental_blocking` mode** (emits a block decision to the runtime) | Intervention-by-enforcement. We do not ship this until `observe`-mode telemetry shows the signal is accurate enough to act on. |
| **Gryph integration** (`gryph-bridge.ts`, `gryph-watch.ts`, the daemon, PID files, the external `safedep/gryph` binary, CAS multi-writer writes) | New external dependency + a long-lived background process. Large maintenance surface for a second-order benefit. Re-evaluated on its own merits. |
| **Auto-installed hooks** (`setup --hooks` wiring PreToolUse panic-check + UserPromptSubmit gryph-watch) | Default install footprint. Users opt in manually until the core is validated. |
| **The observe → memory feedback loop** | The piece that most directly serves the north star: turning "agents reliably get lost in module X on this repo" into a durable memory/orient signal. Designed as its own change once observe-mode data exists. |

## The validation gate (the constraint that governs everything above)

**This change lands the machinery green; it does NOT prove the panic signal is accurate.** That
distinction is the most important thing in this proposal. A freshness signal is a fact ("the index
moved") and is cheap to trust. A panic signal is a *judgment* ("you appear to be thrashing"), and a
wrong judgment is negative value — it spends the tokens we exist to save and interrupts good work.

Therefore: **`observe`-mode validation is a hard gate, not a nice-to-have.** No interventional behavior
(`advisory` injection on by default, `experimental_blocking`, auto-installed hooks) ships *on by
default* until `observe`-mode telemetry from real sessions demonstrates the signal is accurate enough
to act on. Concretely, the gate the follow-up must clear:

- A measured **false-positive rate** (panic raised during work a human judges coherent) low enough that
  acting on the signal is net-positive. If focused deep work trips L2+, the signal is not ready.
- Evidence that **interventions change behavior for the better** — the `panic_intervention_outcome`
  telemetry (orient-after-intervention) trending the right way, not agents ignoring or fighting the nudge.
- A defensible **recovery story** — episodes resolve (via orient or decay), they don't oscillate.

Until that evidence exists, the layer's only sanctioned posture is `off` (default) or `observe`
(silent measurement). Shipping intervention before the gate is cleared is explicitly out of scope and
contrary to the north star. The order is: **land the substrate (this PR) → measure in `observe` →
only then consider turning anything on.**

## North-star alignment (how the core actually helps agents)

- **Saves labor/tokens only if accurate.** The core ships `observe` (silent) so we can measure
  false-positive rate against real sessions *before* any nudge reaches an agent. Intervention is gated
  on that evidence.
- **Feeds useful data — eventually as memory.** The strategic payoff is the deferred observe→memory
  loop: behavioral observability becomes input to the memory layer (where `orient` should invest),
  not just a real-time nag. This change lays the deterministic substrate that loop needs.
- **Costs nothing when off.** Default `off` means existing users and the lean first-run surface are
  untouched; the layer is pure opt-in.

## Execution discipline

- **Rebase, not merge-patch.** PR #83 is built on the V3.2 freshness engine and a since-rewritten
  `mcp.ts` response path; it does not compile after a naive conflict resolution (it imports
  `installClaudeHook`, a symbol `main` has since removed). This change integrates onto current `main`
  and lands **green** (clean `tsc` + passing suite), reviewed, before merge.
- **`record_decision` before the contract.** The `panicResponse.mode` config contract and the
  `updatePanic()`/`updateTracker()` split are architectural; record them before/with the code.
- **Preserve the contributor's work.** Nothing is thrown away. The deferred parts land later on their
  own merits; the credit and the design are Laurent's.

## Out of scope

- Verifying that the panic *signal* is correct (that is the `observe`-mode validation follow-up, not
  this integration).
- Any change to the freshness/EpistemicLease semantics. `updateTracker()` is untouched.
- Turning intervention on by default. The default is, and stays, `off` until proven.
