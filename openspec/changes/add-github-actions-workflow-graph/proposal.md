# GitHub Actions workflow graph: jobs, `needs`, `uses`, and composite/reusable edges on the existing IaC projector

## Why

OpenLore already ingests ten IaC ecosystems (Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm, CloudFormation, Ansible,
Pulumi, CDK, CDKTF, and — pending PR #193 — Dockerfile + docker-compose) by projecting a normalized
resource graph onto the existing call-graph primitives, so `orient`, `search_code`, `get_subgraph`,
`analyze_impact`, and `blast_radius` answer "who depends on this?" over infrastructure with zero tool
changes.

The one layer **nearly every repository on GitHub actually has** — `.github/workflows/` — is still
invisible. `classifyYaml` deliberately returns `null` for CI configs, so a workflow is generic YAML
to the graph. Yet "if I change this composite action / this reusable workflow, which jobs break?",
"what does this job depend on?", and "every job pinned to `actions/checkout@v3` so I can bump it at
once" are exactly graph-reachability questions. CI is also the surface a coding agent collides with
most often — a red check is the single most common thing an agent is asked to fix — and today it has
no structural model of the CI DAG. Closing it is the highest-prevalence, lowest-risk increment left in
the IaC arc.

The CI world maps cleanly onto the existing primitives — it is dependency-graph-shaped, dependent →
dependency, just like the rest of IaC:

| GitHub Actions concept | OpenLore graph primitive |
|---|---|
| A workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) | a node (`FunctionNode`, the workflow handle) |
| A job (`jobs.<id>`) | a node |
| A composite/Docker/JS action (`action.yml`) | a node |
| A marketplace/remote action (`actions/checkout@v4`) | an external node (`isExternal`) |
| `needs: [build]` | an edge, dependent job → dependency job (`depends_on`) |
| step `uses: actions/checkout@v4` | an edge, **job → external action** (`references`) |
| step `uses: ./.github/actions/x` | an edge, **job → local composite action** (cross-file, `references`) |
| job-level `uses: ./.github/workflows/r.yml` | an edge, **job → local reusable workflow** (cross-file, `references`) |
| composite action step `uses: …` | an edge, **action → the action it nests** (`references`) |

The high-value edges are the **cross-file** ones: a job's `uses: ./.github/actions/setup` resolves to
that action's `action.yml` node, and a job-level `uses: ./.github/workflows/release.yml` resolves to
that workflow's handle node. So a single `analyze_impact` on a local composite action answers "every
job in every workflow that would break if I change this action" — end to end, deterministically, no
LLM.

## What changes

1. **One new IaC language tag** — `GitHub Actions` — added to the `IacLanguage` union and
   `IAC_LANGUAGES` (the single source of truth for IaC dispatch and gating). Workflows, jobs, and
   actions all carry it; `className` carries the resource type (`workflow` / `workflow-job` /
   `composite-action` / `action`), exactly as Terraform/K8s use `className` for the resource type. It
   rides the existing projector, so `isIacLanguage` already treats it as infra everywhere (dead-code
   roots, cross-domain linking, graph handlers).

2. **A `github-actions.ts` extractor.** A single `extractGitHubActions(files)` parses **both**
   workflow files and action metadata files together (it needs both for cross-file `uses:`
   resolution) and returns a normalized `IacGraph`:
   - **Workflow** (`.github/workflows/*.yml`): one **workflow** node (named from `name:` or the
     filename, signature carries the `on:` triggers) plus one **job** node per `jobs.<id>`.
     `needs:` → job→job `depends_on` edges. A step's `uses:` → job→action `references` edge. A
     job-level `uses:` (reusable-workflow call) → job→target `references` edge.
   - **Action metadata** (`action.yml`/`action.yaml`): one **action** node (`runs.using` distinguishes
     `composite` / `docker` / `node*`). A composite action's `runs.steps[].uses:` → action→action
     `references` edges.
   - **`uses:` resolution.** A `./`-prefixed ref is **local** (GitHub resolves it relative to the repo
     root): one ending in `.yml`/`.yaml` resolves to that workflow's handle node; otherwise it points
     at a directory whose `action.yml`/`action.yaml` is the target action node. Any other ref is
     **external** (`owner/repo@ref`, `owner/repo/path@ref`, `docker://image`) — an external node,
     deduped by reference string under the one canonical `GitHub Actions` tag, so the same action used
     by ten jobs is one node with fan-in 10.
   - **Determinism & honesty**: output is sorted (the projector already sorts), so rebuilds are
     byte-identical. A dynamic ref (`uses: ${{ matrix.action }}`, a templated reusable path) and a
     `./` local ref whose target file is not in the indexed set emit **no edge** —
     `TODO(spec-07-followup): dynamic …` — never a wrong one. Malformed-but-recoverable YAML is ignored
     rather than minting a garbage node (same posture as the compose parser).

3. **Detection in `classifyYaml` + the analyze-time `resolveLang` layer, not `detectLanguage`.**
   Consistent with every other IaC ecosystem: `detectLanguage` (which the incremental watcher consults)
   stays unchanged, so a workflow edit never reaches the watcher's empty-result node-deletion path.
   Workflows are recognized by path (`.github/workflows/*.y?ml`) corroborated by top-level `on:` + `jobs:`;
   action metadata by filename (`action.y?ml`) corroborated by a top-level `runs:` key.
   `CALL_GRAPH_LANGS` gains the tag so the files reach the IaC projection pass.

## Scope contract — do not break these things

This change must NOT:
- Change the `FunctionNode` / `CallEdge` / `ClassNode` schema, the MCP tools, or `orient`. GitHub
  Actions rides the existing primitives, exactly like spec-07.
- Regress any existing language or IaC ecosystem. All current extractors and tests stay green.
- Touch `detectLanguage` (and therefore the incremental watcher's deletion-sensitive path) — GitHub
  Actions matches the established analyze-time IaC limitation (full re-analyze picks up changes; same
  as Terraform/K8s YAML today).
- Evaluate anything: no `${{ }}` expression evaluation, no `act`, no matrix expansion, no API calls.
  Static parse only.
- Over-promise precision. Emit only statically-resolvable edges; for the rest emit nothing and leave a
  `TODO(spec-07-followup): …`.

## Out of scope (deferred, as spec-07 deferred adjacent surfaces)

GitLab CI / CircleCI / Azure Pipelines / other CI ecosystems, `${{ matrix }}` fan-out as distinct
nodes, step-level granularity (steps are not nodes; the job is the unit, like a Dockerfile stage is the
unit not each `RUN`), `outputs`/`env`/`secrets` dataflow as first-class edges (low signal, high noise),
remote reusable-workflow *contents* (an `owner/repo/.github/workflows/x.yml@ref` is an external node,
not fetched), and incremental-watch support for workflow files (matches all IaC YAML today).

## Architectural decision (recorded here; `record_decision` not in the lean tool surface)

**Project GitHub Actions onto the existing IaC primitives via one new language tag and one extractor —
do not add a graph schema, MCP tool, or watcher path.** Rationale: the CI DAG is dependent→dependency
shaped and already served by `analyze_impact`/`get_subgraph`/`blast_radius`; the spec-07 projector is
the proven, zero-tool-change seam (Terraform → … → Docker all rode it). Consequence: CI topology is
analyze-time only (no live watch), and only statically-resolvable `uses:`/`needs:` edges are emitted —
dynamic refs are dropped, never guessed. This mirrors decision "IaC projects onto existing graph" and
the Docker container-graph follow-up.

## Implementation status

Tracked in `tasks.md`. Verified by `src/core/analyzer/iac/github-actions.test.ts` (unit) and the IaC
`integration.test.ts` (end-to-end through `CallGraphBuilder`), plus a dogfood run on OpenLore's own
`.github/` (workflows `ci.yml`/`release.yml` + the `openlore-review` composite action), recorded in
`DOGFOOD-github-actions-workflow-graph.md`.
