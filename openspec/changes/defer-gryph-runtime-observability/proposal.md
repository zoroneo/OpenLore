# Gryph runtime observability (deferred follow-up from PR #83)

## Why it was deferred

Gryph is the part of PR #83 that carries the most cost and the widest maintenance surface: a new
external dependency (the `safedep/gryph` binary), a long-lived background process, PID-file singleton
management, and CAS multi-writer coordination. None of that should gate the deterministic core, and its
benefit (observing agents that work purely via Bash/Edit/Read, invisible to the MCP-path signal model)
is second-order and unproven until the core signal itself is validated.

## What it restores (Laurent's design, intact)

- `gryph-bridge.ts` — `queryGryphSignals()` / `applyGryphDelta()` / `startGryphPolling()` with fail-open
  absence semantics, PascalCase Gryph event mapping, `repetitiveRetryBurst` + `largePatchWhileStale`
  signals, passive decay in `applySnapshotDelta()`.
- `gryph-watch.ts` — standalone observer process (`openlore gryph-watch`), singleton via PID file,
  while-loop poller (no `setInterval` drift), SIGTERM/SIGINT/stdin-EOF exit, `_pollerRegistry` one-per-
  workspace guard.
- `panic-check.ts` Gryph enrichment block (query from `gryphWindowStart`, 2-min fallback).
- Env: `OPENLORE_GRYPH_TIMEOUT_MS`, `OPENLORE_GRYPH_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`.

The original files are recoverable from PR #83 (`feat/panic-response-layer`,
`gryph-bridge.ts` / `gryph-watch.ts` / `gryph-bridge.test.ts`).

## What is already in place (inert plumbing, shipped in PR #175)

These were intentionally kept dormant so this follow-up is a clean re-attach, not a re-architecture:

- `PanicState.gryphWindowStart` and `PanicState.revision` fields.
- `casWritePanicState()` (compare-and-swap write) in `panic-response.ts`.
- `GRYPH_*` constants in `panic-constants.ts`.
- The monotonic-revision invariant across writers (now enforced on the MCP write path), which the
  Gryph CAS poll relies on.

## Gate

Blocked on the observe-mode accuracy gate (`adopt-agent-behavioral-governance`): do not add a second
behavioral source until the first one is shown to be accurate. Re-evaluate the external-dependency cost
on its own merits at that point.

## Out of scope

- Bundling or vendoring the `safedep/gryph` binary. Gryph stays optional; absence is zero-impact.
