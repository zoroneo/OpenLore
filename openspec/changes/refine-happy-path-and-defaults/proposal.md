## The gap

OpenLore is, by capability, ahead of the field. It ships 72 MCP tools across six capability families,
49 CLI commands, 18 languages plus 12 IaC ecosystems, a shared graph + anchored-fact store + freshness
lease, and an honest-by-construction posture (losses published next to wins). The November 2025
frontier guidance from Anthropic and OpenAI — curate a small default surface, defer the long tail,
disambiguate overlapping tools, return concise outputs — describes patterns OpenLore *already
implements* (lean `navigation` default, capability families, `NoRedundantConclusions`, token-budgeted
conclusions). The product is aligned with the frontier, not behind it.

And yet the **happy path under-delivers relative to the capability.** A new user — human or agent —
who installs OpenLore the documented way meets a narrower, rougher, less self-explanatory product than
the one that actually exists. The breadth is real; the *first encounter* with it is not yet world-class.
Seven concrete gaps, each grounded in the current code:

1. **The default surface under-sells the substrate.** The out-of-box default is the `navigation`
   preset — 10 tools, all `navigate` family, the read face only (`TOOL_PRESETS.navigation` in
   `src/cli/commands/mcp.ts`). An agent wired the documented way never discovers that the same
   substrate also *remembers* (`recall`), *verifies its own claims* (`verify_claim`), or *weighs a diff*
   (`blast_radius`) unless it opts in by preset name. The `substrate` preset (both faces, 13 tools)
   exists precisely to fix this but is **not** the active default — the flip is gated on an agent
   benchmark that the `unify-navigation-and-governance-substrate` change explicitly deferred
   (`tasks.md`: "Run the agent benchmark on `substrate` vs `navigation` — **benchmark not run here**").
   The headline promise of the README ("OpenLore does two things … remembers … governs") is not what
   the default install delivers.

2. **First-run degrades silently instead of being ready or honest.** The whole value is invisible until
   the structural index exists, but nothing *guarantees* it exists at the first tool call. On cold start
   with no analysis, graph-dependent tools return empty / BM25-only results behind a soft note
   (`orient.ts` `graphIndexNote`), not a clear "I am not ready — run this one command" signal. A schema
   bump silently empties the graph tables (`edge-store.ts` `SCHEMA_VERSION`) and the watcher historically
   skipped the rebuild. Node < 22.5 crashes on `node:sqlite` with a cryptic `DatabaseSync` error.
   `doctor` has exited non-zero on the *absence of an optional LLM key* — failing the very no-LLM path
   the product is built to make first-class. Several of these have in-flight fixes; none is yet a
   *spec-level guarantee* that first use is **ready or honest, never silently wrong.**

3. **Naming inconsistency taxes agent tool-selection.** Anthropic and OpenAI both report that overlapping
   or inconsistently-named tools make models "call the wrong one or hesitate to call any at all." The
   surface has catalogued inconsistencies: `get_ui_components` breaks the `get_*_inventory` pattern its
   siblings (`get_route_inventory`, `get_schema_inventory`) follow; `remember`/`recall` are bare verbs
   while every other write tool is `verb_noun` (`record_decision`); near-identical queries split across
   `search_*`, `find_*`, and `get_*`. None is fatal; together they erode selection accuracy the
   literature says is measurable.

4. **No concise/detailed output mode.** Anthropic publishes a verified ~3× token reduction (206 → 72
   tokens) from offering a `response_format: concise | detailed` on verbose tools, and Claude Code warns
   above 10,000 tokens of tool output. OpenLore's conclusions are already token-budgeted, but there is no
   uniform, agent-selectable verbosity control, and no spec guarantee that every tool stays under the
   warning line or returns a *truncation receipt that tells the agent how to narrow* rather than an
   opaque cut.

5. **The full catalog is exposed as a binary, not progressively.** The preset system is server-side
   progressive disclosure — but it is *all-or-curated*: an agent gets the 10-tool default or must name a
   wider preset up front. Anthropic shipped native **Tool Search / `defer_loading`** in November 2025
   (catalog up to 10,000 tools; long-tail definitions excluded from the prompt prefix; ~85% token
   reduction and measured accuracy gains on the same catalog). OpenLore can expose its *full* 72-tool
   catalog at no upfront token cost where the host supports deferral — keeping every capability one
   model-initiated search away instead of one human-typed preset flag away.

6. **The CLI and docs surface is sprawling and hard to navigate.** 49 top-level commands print as one
   flat `--help` list; the experimental `panic-*` suite and `gryph-watch` sit beside `install` and
   `orient` with no altitude marker. 44 docs files carry real overlap (`languages.md` vs
   `language-support.md`; `agent-setup.md` vs `install.md`; `configuration.md` vs `providers.md`) and
   several stale artifacts (`RENAME-TO-OPENLORE.md`, `plan-rag-improvements.md`). There is no single
   "where do I turn on X?" map, even though the answer is "0 required config keys, N opt-in features."

7. **Good defaults can drift, and feature activation is undiscoverable.** Two sub-points. (a) Default
   constants risk drifting from the live config defaults and the documented counts risk going stale —
   though on inspection the headline cases are already healthy (`DEFAULT_ANTHROPIC_MODEL` is
   `claude-sonnet-4-6` and `mcp-tool-count-doc.test.ts` already guards the published tool count), so this
   reduces to *keeping a guard in place* rather than fixing a live contradiction. (b) More importantly,
   the product has zero required config but no map of the ~10 independent *opt-in* features (embeddings,
   covering surfaces, enforcement policy, blast-radius blocking, spec store, panic mode, …): a user who
   wants one has to know the key, the file, and which of ~44 docs to read. There is no single
   "where do I turn on X?" answer.

None of these is a missing capability. Every one is a *finish* problem: the difference between a product
that *has* world-class plumbing and one that *feels* world-class the first time you touch it.

## The principle

One sentence governs every requirement below:

> **The first five minutes and the first five tool calls SHALL reveal the full value of the substrate,
> with zero required configuration and zero silent wrong turns — and the long tail SHALL stay one
> model-initiated step away, never removed.**

This is the north star applied to *onboarding and surface ergonomics* rather than to analysis: the same
"deterministic, local-first, conclusion-over-graph, honest when stale" posture, extended from what a
tool *returns* to how the product is *first met and navigated.* It is deliberately a **refinement**
mandate, not an expansion one — it adds no analysis capability and removes none. Its non-goals are as
load-bearing as its goals (see Non-goals), because the user's constraint is explicit: refine and
optimize **without losing any value.**

## What changes (spec only)

Six themes, each a small set of enforceable requirements across the relevant existing domains. This
section is the map; the full requirement text and Given/When/Then scenarios are inlined below in
**Spec deltas** (kept in this one file for a self-contained read; at archive time they consolidate into
`specs/<domain>/spec.md` per the repo's change-consolidation convention).

### Theme A — A first run that is *ready or honest*, never silently wrong (`cli`, `mcp-handlers`)

- **`ReadyOrHonestFirstUse`** (`mcp-handlers`, ADDED). A graph-dependent tool invoked before a usable
  index exists SHALL either (a) transparently trigger and await the first build, or (b) return a single
  explicit *not-ready* conclusion carrying a machine-readable flag and the exact one command to fix it —
  and SHALL NOT return silently-degraded empty/keyword-only results presented as authoritative. The
  freshness lease SHALL distinguish *absent* from *stale* so an agent never mistakes "no index" for "no
  findings."
- **`GuaranteedIndexAtFirstSession`** (`cli`, ADDED). `install` builds the index by default; if the
  build is skipped or fails, the failure is surfaced with its one remediation command, and the
  cold-start MCP server self-bootstraps a first build on first graph-tool use rather than degrading. A
  schema reset SHALL schedule an automatic rebuild, not leave an empty store.
- **`TruthfulDoctorExitCodes`** (`cli`, MODIFIED). `doctor` SHALL exit `0` whenever the no-LLM,
  no-API-key happy path is fully functional; the absence of an optional LLM/embedding key SHALL be a
  `warn`, never a `fail`. The runtime Node floor (≥ 22.5, for `node:sqlite`) SHALL be checked to the
  minor version with an actionable message, not crash cryptically downstream.

### Theme B — Defaults that reveal the whole substrate (`mcp-quality`)

- **`DefaultSurfaceRevealsAllFaces`** (`mcp-quality`, ADDED). The active out-of-box default surface SHALL
  expose at least one tool from each high-value face of the substrate — navigate, recall (remember),
  verify, and change-weigh — so that an agent installing the documented way discovers the governance
  face without opting in by name. This change **discharges the deferred benchmark obligation**: the
  `substrate` (or a measured equivalent) default SHALL be evaluated against `navigation` on the agent
  benchmark, and the default SHALL move to the broader face-complete surface unless that evaluation
  shows a regression. The decision and its evidence SHALL be recorded (`record_decision`).
- **`ProgressiveCatalogDisclosure`** (`mcp-quality`, ADDED). Where the MCP host supports tool-search /
  deferred tool loading, the server SHALL expose the *full* catalog with a curated core loaded eagerly
  and the long tail marked deferred, so breadth costs no upfront context. The eager core SHALL stay
  within the platform's selection-accuracy guidance (curated, well under the documented 30–50-tool
  degradation threshold); deferral SHALL preserve prompt-cache stability. Where the host does **not**
  support deferral, the preset system remains the fallback and no capability is lost.

### Theme C — Naming and description hygiene that aids selection (`mcp-quality`)

- **`ConsistentToolNaming`** (`mcp-quality`, ADDED). Every tool name SHALL follow `verb_noun`
  snake_case; the catalogued inconsistencies SHALL be reconciled. Any rename SHALL ship the prior name
  as a permanent deprecated alias resolving to the same handler — **no caller breaks, no value is lost.**
- **`DisambiguatingDescriptionsInProse`** (`mcp-quality`, MODIFIED — extends `NoRedundantConclusions`).
  Each adjacent/overlapping tool SHALL name its near-sibling and state *when to use this vs. that*
  **in the human-readable description prose** the model actually reads, not only as a CI cross-reference
  guard. Descriptions SHALL lead with the action and state both when-to-use and when-not.

### Theme D — Output economy by default (`mcp-handlers`)

- **`ConciseByDefaultDetailedOnRequest`** (`mcp-handlers`, ADDED). Any tool whose detailed output can
  exceed a concise summary SHALL accept a `responseFormat: concise | detailed` parameter defaulting to
  `concise`. Every tool's response SHALL stay within the host's tool-output warning budget by default;
  a bounded/truncated result SHALL return a *truncation receipt* — the omitted count and the exact
  narrower call to make — never an opaque cut. This extends, and does not weaken, the existing
  token-budget and provenance-edge ceilings.

### Theme E — Configuration that stays zero-config but discoverable (`config`, `cli`)

- **`ZeroConfigWithGuidedActivation`** (`config`, ADDED). The product SHALL require **zero** config keys
  for full first-run value (preserve the current baseline). It SHALL also provide a single command that
  lists every opt-in feature (embeddings, `impactCertificate.surfaces`, `enforcement.policy`,
  `blastRadius.block`, `specStore`, `panicResponse.mode`), whether each is currently active, and the one
  command or config snippet that activates it — answering "where do I turn on X?" without reading 44 docs.
- **`DefaultsTrackCurrentLineage`** (`config`, ADDED). Shipped default constants SHALL not contradict the
  runtime config defaults; the default model pin SHALL track the current supported lineage, and a guard
  SHALL fail CI when a documented "N tools" / "N languages" figure drifts from the measured source of
  truth (`TOOL_DEFINITIONS.length`, the language registry).

### Theme F — A legible command and documentation surface (`cli`, `overview`)

- **`CommandSurfaceGroupedByJob`** (`cli`, ADDED). `openlore --help` SHALL group its commands by job —
  *set up*, *navigate*, *govern a change*, *inspect*, *advanced/experimental* — mirroring the capability
  families, with the experimental suites (`panic-*`, `gryph-watch`) under an explicitly-marked advanced
  group. All commands remain available; only the *presentation* is grouped.
- **`DocumentationSingleSourceOfTruth`** (`overview`, ADDED). Each concept SHALL have one canonical doc;
  catalogued duplicates SHALL be merged or cross-linked to a canonical page, stale artifacts retired,
  and a task→doc index SHALL map a user's intent to the one page that answers it. No reference content
  is deleted without redirect.

## Why this is the right altitude

Every theme above is backed by current, citable guidance, and each maps to a gap that is a *finish*
problem rather than a capability gap:

- **Default-surface breadth and the 30–50-tool threshold** — Anthropic: selection accuracy "degrades
  significantly once you exceed 30–50 available tools"; reach for tool search at 10+ tools / 10K tokens.
  (`platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-search-tool`.) OpenLore's 10-tool default
  is safely inside this; the opportunity is to make those 10 *face-complete*, not to shrink further.
- **Progressive disclosure / Tool Search** — Anthropic, Nov 2025: `defer_loading` excludes long-tail
  definitions from the prompt prefix, ~85% token reduction with preserved accuracy on the same catalog;
  catalog up to 10,000 tools. (`anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use`.) This is the exact
  mechanism for "big catalog, small loaded set."
- **Naming and disambiguation** — Anthropic and OpenAI both: consistent `verb_noun`, lead-with-action
  descriptions, and explicit "use X instead" sibling pointers measurably improve selection;
  inconsistency is "cognitive overhead for agents." (`anthropic.com/engineering/writing-tools-for-agents`,
  `developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/function-calling`.)
- **Concise outputs** — Anthropic: a `response_format` enum yields ~3× fewer tokens (72 vs 206);
  Claude Code caps tool output at 25K tokens and warns at 10K; verbose outputs drive "context rot."
  (`anthropic.com/engineering/writing-tools-for-agents`, `code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp`.)
- **Zero-config + no stdio noise + ready-or-honest** — practitioner and Anthropic mechanism-level
  guidance converge: sensible defaults, operate with zero required config, never emit noise that
  corrupts a stdio client, and steer the agent with instructions rather than opaque errors on
  truncation. (`steipete.me/posts/2025/mcp-best-practices`, Anthropic tool-writing guidance.)

These are not a re-architecture. They are the set of refinements that move OpenLore from *has the best
substrate* to *feels like the best substrate the first time you touch it.*

## Non-goals (value preservation — load-bearing)

This change SHALL NOT, under any requirement:

- Remove any MCP tool, CLI command, preset, language, or capability. The full 72-tool surface stays
  reachable (`--preset full` / `--all-tools`), and every renamed tool keeps its old name as a permanent
  alias.
- Gate any existing capability behind new required configuration. Zero required keys stays zero.
- Introduce an LLM call, network dependency, or persisted artifact into any hot path. Determinism and
  local-first are preserved.
- Merge two tools that return genuinely distinct conclusions (`NoRedundantConclusions` is reinforced,
  not relaxed) — disambiguation is by description and naming, not by collapsing answers into a `mode`
  flag.
- Delete reference documentation without a redirect to its canonical replacement.

The test for every requirement: a long-time power user who relies on an obscure tool, an exact CLI name,
or a deep doc page SHALL find that exact affordance still present after this change — only easier to
discover and harder to meet in a degraded state.

## Impact

- **Specs:** `cli`, `mcp-quality`, `mcp-handlers`, `config`, `overview` (deltas in `specs/`).
- **Likely code (at implementation time, out of scope for this spec change):** the default preset
  selection (`LEAN_DEFAULT_PRESET`), `doctor` exit logic, cold-start build trigger, tool naming aliases
  and `responseFormat` plumbing in `mcp-handlers/*`, an `openlore config`/activation command, `--help`
  grouping in `src/cli/index.ts`, a docs consolidation pass, and a default-drift CI guard. Each new
  tool/structure/default-flip at implementation time calls `record_decision` first, per `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Benchmark obligation:** `DefaultSurfaceRevealsAllFaces` requires the deferred `substrate`-vs-
  `navigation` agent benchmark to actually run and its result to be recorded — closing the open `[~]`
  task from `unify-navigation-and-governance-substrate`.

default-flipping* — no existing requirement is weakened, and the Non-goals above bound every one.

## `mcp-handlers` spec delta

### ADDED Requirements

#### Requirement: ReadyOrHonestFirstUse

A graph-dependent tool invoked before a usable structural index exists SHALL be **ready or honest, never
silently wrong**. It SHALL NOT return empty or keyword-only results *presented as authoritative* when the
true cause is an absent or reset index. Specifically, such a tool SHALL either:

1. transparently trigger and await the first index build (cold-start self-bootstrap), then answer; or
2. return a single explicit *not-ready* conclusion carrying a machine-readable flag (e.g. `notReady: true`
   with a cause of `absent` or `reset`) and the **exact one command** to make it ready
   (`openlore analyze`).

The freshness lease SHALL distinguish an **absent** index from a **stale** one, so that an agent never
mistakes "no index built yet" for "no findings exist." No tool SHALL emit progress, banner, or diagnostic
text to stdout on a stdio MCP transport (it corrupts the client); not-ready signaling SHALL travel in the
structured result.

##### Scenario: A graph tool called before any index exists is honest, not empty

- **GIVEN** a freshly wired repository whose structural index has never been built
- **WHEN** an agent calls a graph-dependent tool (e.g. `orient`, `analyze_impact`)
- **THEN** the tool either self-bootstraps the first build and answers, or returns a `notReady`
  conclusion naming the cause and the single command to run
- **AND** it does not return an empty result that an agent could read as "nothing found"

##### Scenario: A schema reset is reported as absent, not as no-findings

- **GIVEN** an index whose backing store was emptied by a schema-version bump
- **WHEN** a graph-dependent tool is called before the rebuild completes
- **THEN** the freshness lease reports the index as absent/reset (not merely stale, not silently empty)
- **AND** the tool's result carries the not-ready flag and the rebuild command

#### Requirement: ConciseByDefaultDetailedOnRequest

Any tool whose detailed output can exceed a concise summary SHALL accept a `responseFormat` parameter with
values `concise` and `detailed`, defaulting to `concise`. Each tool's response SHALL stay within the
host's tool-output warning budget by default (e.g. under the 10,000-token Claude Code warning line). A
bounded or truncated result SHALL return a **truncation receipt** — the count of omitted items and the
exact narrower call to retrieve them — rather than an opaque cut or a silent cap. This requirement
extends, and SHALL NOT weaken, the existing token-budget and `MAX_PROVENANCE_EDGES` ceilings.

##### Scenario: Default output is concise and selectable

- **GIVEN** a tool capable of a long detailed answer
- **WHEN** an agent calls it without specifying `responseFormat`
- **THEN** it returns the concise form, within the host output warning budget
- **AND** the agent can request `responseFormat: detailed` to get the full form

##### Scenario: A truncated result tells the agent how to narrow

- **GIVEN** a query whose full result exceeds the bound
- **WHEN** the tool truncates
- **THEN** it returns the omitted count and the exact narrower call (filter, scope, or pagination cursor)
- **AND** it does not return a silently-capped list indistinguishable from a complete one

## `mcp-quality` spec delta

### ADDED Requirements

#### Requirement: DefaultSurfaceRevealsAllFaces

The active out-of-box default tool surface SHALL expose at least one tool from each high-value face of the
substrate — **navigate**, **recall** (the remember family's read), **verify**, and **change-weigh** — so
that an agent installed the documented way discovers the governance face without opting in by preset name.
This requirement discharges the benchmark obligation deferred by
`unify-navigation-and-governance-substrate`: the face-complete surface (the `substrate` preset, or a
measured equivalent) SHALL be evaluated against the `navigation` default on the agent benchmark, and the
active default SHALL move to the face-complete surface **unless** that evaluation shows a regression in
selection accuracy or token economy. The decision and its evidence SHALL be recorded via
`record_decision`. The lean `navigation` and every other preset SHALL remain selectable; only the default
changes.

##### Scenario: The default install reveals the governance face

- **GIVEN** a user who installs OpenLore with no preset flag
- **WHEN** their agent enumerates the available tools
- **THEN** the surface includes at least one navigate, one recall, one verify, and one change-weigh tool
- **AND** the agent can record and recall facts and weigh a diff without naming a preset

##### Scenario: The default flip is evidence-gated, not assumed

- **GIVEN** the face-complete candidate surface and the lean navigation surface
- **WHEN** the active default is chosen
- **THEN** the choice is backed by an agent-benchmark result recorded as a decision
- **AND** if the broader surface regresses selection accuracy or token economy, the default stays lean
  and the face-complete surface remains a named preset

#### Requirement: ProgressiveCatalogDisclosure

Where the MCP host supports tool-search / deferred tool loading, the server SHALL expose the **full**
catalog with a curated core loaded eagerly and the long-tail tools marked deferred, so that breadth costs
no upfront context. The eager core SHALL remain within the platform's documented selection-accuracy
guidance (curated, well under the 30–50-tool degradation threshold). Deferral SHALL be implemented so as
to preserve prompt-cache stability (long-tail definitions excluded from the cached prefix). Where the host
does **not** support deferral, the existing preset system is the fallback and **no capability is lost** —
the full surface stays reachable via `--preset full` / `--all-tools`.

##### Scenario: A deferral-capable host sees the whole catalog at low cost

- **GIVEN** an MCP host that supports deferred tool loading
- **WHEN** the server advertises its tools
- **THEN** a curated core is loaded eagerly and the remaining tools are marked deferred
- **AND** the model can pull any deferred tool on demand without it occupying the upfront context

##### Scenario: A host without deferral loses no capability

- **GIVEN** a host that does not support deferred loading
- **WHEN** OpenLore is wired
- **THEN** it falls back to the preset system
- **AND** the full surface remains reachable via an explicit full preset

#### Requirement: ConsistentToolNaming

> ✅ IMPLEMENTED (2026-06-28, PR #218) — first increment. The permanent alias mechanism is in place:
> `TOOL_NAME_ALIASES` (prior → canonical) + `resolveCanonicalToolName()` in `tool-contract.ts`, resolved
> up front on BOTH transports (`mcp.ts` CallTool handler + `tool-dispatch.ts` entry, reused by `serve`),
> so a renamed tool's prior name keeps working forever. Applied to the one catalogued inconsistency:
> `get_ui_components` → `get_ui_component_inventory` (now sharing the `_inventory` suffix with
> `get_route_inventory`/`get_middleware_inventory`/`get_schema_inventory`). Guards in `tool-aliases.test.ts`:
> every alias targets a registered tool, no alias shadows a live name, all names are snake_case, and the
> inventory-retriever family shares its suffix. `remember`/`recall`/`orient` are intentionally NOT renamed
> (memorable single-verb names; renaming would be value-destroying churn — see Non-goals). Future
> renames reuse this mechanism.

Every tool name SHALL follow `verb_noun` snake_case. The catalogued inconsistencies SHALL be reconciled so
that sibling tools share a pattern (inventory retrievers share a suffix; durable-fact operations share the
write-family `verb_noun` shape). Any rename SHALL ship the prior name as a **permanent deprecated alias**
that resolves to the same handler, so that no existing caller, prompt, or doc breaks. A CI guard SHALL
fail when a newly added tool violates the naming pattern.

##### Scenario: A renamed tool keeps its old name working

- **GIVEN** a tool that is renamed for consistency
- **WHEN** a caller invokes the old name
- **THEN** the call resolves to the same handler and returns the same result
- **AND** the old name is documented as a deprecated alias, not removed

##### Scenario: A new tool must follow the naming pattern

- **GIVEN** a newly authored tool whose name violates `verb_noun` snake_case
- **WHEN** the test suite runs
- **THEN** the naming guard fails CI until the name is reconciled

### MODIFIED Requirements

#### Requirement: NoRedundantConclusions

Adjacent or overlapping tools — those answering closely related questions over the same graph — SHALL NOT
be merged when each returns a genuinely distinct conclusion; they SHALL instead disambiguate. This
requirement is **strengthened**: disambiguation SHALL appear in the human-readable description **prose the
model reads**, not only as a CI cross-reference guard. Each such tool's description SHALL lead with its
action, name its near-sibling explicitly, and state *when to use this tool versus the sibling* (when-to-use
and when-not). The CI guard that asserts the cross-reference exists is retained as the floor, not the
ceiling.

##### Scenario: An adjacent tool's prose disambiguates it from its sibling

- **GIVEN** two tools that answer adjacent questions (e.g. `blast_radius` vs `change_impact_certificate`)
- **WHEN** a model reads either tool's description
- **THEN** the description names the sibling and states when to prefer each
- **AND** the two tools are not merged, because each returns a distinct conclusion

##### Scenario: The CI guard remains the floor

- **GIVEN** an adjacent tool whose description omits its sibling cross-reference
- **WHEN** the contract test runs
- **THEN** CI fails, as before
- **AND** the prose-quality requirement is an additional obligation beyond the guard

## `cli` spec delta

### ADDED Requirements

#### Requirement: GuaranteedIndexAtFirstSession

`openlore install` SHALL build the structural index by default. If the build is skipped (`--no-analyze`)
or fails, the outcome SHALL be surfaced with the single command that completes it, and the cold-start MCP
server SHALL self-bootstrap a first build on first graph-tool use rather than serving degraded results
(see `ReadyOrHonestFirstUse`). A schema-version reset SHALL schedule an automatic rebuild rather than
leaving an empty store. Every terminal command SHALL print exactly **one** clear next action.

##### Scenario: Install leaves the agent able to orient in the next session

- **GIVEN** a user runs `openlore install` with defaults
- **WHEN** install completes
- **THEN** the index is built (or its absence is surfaced with the one command to build it)
- **AND** the agent's first `orient` in the next session returns a real answer, not a degraded one

##### Scenario: A skipped build is recoverable in one step

- **GIVEN** a user runs `openlore install --no-analyze`
- **WHEN** the summary prints
- **THEN** it states the single command (`openlore analyze`) that completes setup
- **AND** the cold-start server self-bootstraps on first graph-tool use if the user does not run it

### MODIFIED Requirements

#### Requirement: TruthfulDoctorExitCodes

> ✅ ALREADY SATISFIED in `main` (verified 2026-06-28, PR #218). `doctor` returns `warn` (not `fail`) for
> a missing optional LLM/embedding key and exits `0` on the no-LLM happy path (exit `1` only on a genuine
> `fail`: bad Node version, missing/unparseable config, critically low disk). The Node floor is checked to
> the minor version (≥ 22.5, for `node:sqlite`). Locked by existing tests in `doctor.test.ts`
> ("missing LLM/embedding alone does NOT fail (exit stays 0)", "warns (not fails) when … missing API key").
> No code change required by this change.

`openlore doctor` SHALL exit `0` whenever the no-LLM, no-API-key happy path is fully functional. The
absence of an optional LLM or embedding API key SHALL be reported as a `warn`, never a `fail`, and SHALL
NOT cause a non-zero exit. The runtime Node version floor required by `node:sqlite` (≥ 22.5) SHALL be
checked to the **minor** version, with an actionable message, rather than allowed to crash a downstream
component cryptically. Required-but-missing setup (no index, unwired agent) MAY still fail; optional
capability absence MAY NOT.

##### Scenario: Doctor passes on the pure no-LLM setup

- **GIVEN** a correctly installed repo with the index built and no LLM API key configured
- **WHEN** `openlore doctor` runs
- **THEN** it exits `0`
- **AND** it reports the missing optional LLM key as a warning, not a failure

##### Scenario: An unsupported Node version is reported, not crashed

- **GIVEN** a shell whose active Node is below 22.5 (e.g. pinned by `.nvmrc`)
- **WHEN** `openlore doctor` runs
- **THEN** it reports the version floor and the remediation
- **AND** the MCP server and hooks do not later crash with an opaque `node:sqlite` error

### ADDED Requirements

#### Requirement: CommandSurfaceGroupedByJob

> ✅ IMPLEMENTED (2026-06-28, PR #218). `src/cli/help-groups.ts` defines the job groups and a
> `groupedFormatHelp` that faithfully reproduces Commander 12's `formatHelp` but renders the Commands
> section grouped by job; wired via `program.configureHelp({ formatHelp: groupedFormatHelp })`. The
> `panic-*` suite and `gryph-watch` are under "Advanced / experimental". Presentation only — every
> command stays invocable, and any uncategorized command falls to an "Other" group (never hidden).
> Tests: `help-groups.test.ts` (6 cases) + an `index-help.test.ts` wiring guard.

`openlore --help` SHALL present its commands grouped by job — *set up*, *navigate*, *govern a change*,
*inspect*, and *advanced / experimental* — rather than as one flat alphabetical list, mirroring the
capability-family taxonomy. The experimental suites (the `panic-*` family, `gryph-watch`) SHALL appear
under an explicitly-labeled advanced/experimental group. All commands SHALL remain invocable; only their
*presentation* is grouped.

##### Scenario: Help groups commands by job

- **GIVEN** a user runs `openlore --help`
- **WHEN** the help renders
- **THEN** commands appear under job-based groups, with experimental suites marked as such
- **AND** every command remains directly invocable by name

## `config` spec delta

### ADDED Requirements

#### Requirement: ZeroConfigWithGuidedActivation

> ✅ IMPLEMENTED (2026-06-28, branch `feat/guided-feature-activation`). The single command is
> `openlore features` (+ `--json`, `--inactive`), backed by the shared, dependency-light
> `collectFeatureInventory()` in `src/core/services/feature-inventory.ts` — deterministic, local,
> fail-soft, reusable by `doctor`/MCP for parity. It detects 11 features (9 genuinely opt-in) from
> config + on-disk markers and reports, for each, its state and the one command/snippet to activate it.
> The front-door `--help` epilog names the command (guarded by `index-help.test.ts`). 17 unit tests in
> `feature-inventory.test.ts`. The zero-required-key baseline is unchanged and surfaced as
> `requiredConfigKeys: 0`.

OpenLore SHALL require **zero** configuration keys for full first-run value; the current zero-required-key
baseline SHALL be preserved. It SHALL additionally provide a single command that lists every opt-in
feature — embeddings, `impactCertificate.surfaces`, `enforcement.policy`, `blastRadius.block`,
`specStore`, `panicResponse.mode` — reporting for each whether it is currently active and the one command
or config snippet that activates it. This answers "where do I turn on X?" without requiring the user to
read the documentation set.

##### Scenario: A user runs with no config and gets value

- **GIVEN** a repo with only the auto-generated default config
- **WHEN** the user runs `openlore analyze` and the agent calls `orient`
- **THEN** it works with no hand-edited config keys

##### Scenario: One command reveals how to turn on any opt-in feature

- **GIVEN** a user who wants to enable an opt-in feature but does not know the key
- **WHEN** they run the activation-status command
- **THEN** it lists each opt-in feature, its active/inactive state, and the exact way to enable it

#### Requirement: DefaultsTrackCurrentLineage

Shipped default constants SHALL NOT contradict the runtime config defaults. The default model pin SHALL
track the current supported model lineage rather than a dated identifier. A CI guard SHALL fail when a
documented "N tools" or "N languages" figure drifts from its measured source of truth
(`TOOL_DEFINITIONS.length`, the language-support registry), so published counts cannot silently go stale.

##### Scenario: The default model constant matches the runtime default

- **GIVEN** the compiled default model constant and the runtime config default
- **WHEN** they are compared
- **THEN** they agree and reference a currently-supported model
- **AND** a stale dated pin is not shipped

##### Scenario: A documented count that drifts fails CI

- **GIVEN** documentation that states the tool or language count
- **WHEN** the measured count diverges from the documented figure
- **THEN** the drift guard fails CI until the figure is corrected

## `overview` spec delta

### ADDED Requirements

#### Requirement: DocumentationSingleSourceOfTruth

Each concept SHALL have exactly one canonical documentation page. Catalogued duplicates (e.g. language
support, agent setup, provider/configuration) SHALL be merged into, or cross-linked to, a single
canonical page; stale artifacts SHALL be retired. A task→doc index SHALL map a user's intent ("turn on
embeddings", "gate a commit", "wire my agent") to the one page that answers it. No reference content SHALL
be deleted without a redirect to its canonical replacement.

##### Scenario: A concept resolves to one canonical page

- **GIVEN** two pages that document the same concept
- **WHEN** the docs are consolidated
- **THEN** one is canonical and the other redirects or cross-links to it
- **AND** no reference content is lost without a redirect

##### Scenario: A user's intent maps to one page

- **GIVEN** a user with a task in mind
- **WHEN** they consult the task→doc index
- **THEN** it points them to the single canonical page for that task
