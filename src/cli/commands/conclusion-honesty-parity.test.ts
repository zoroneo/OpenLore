/**
 * Conclusion-honesty parity guard (change: fix-cli-conclusion-honesty).
 *
 * The honesty disciplines — resolve-or-disclose a `--base` ref, disclose index
 * staleness on a cached-graph conclusion — are only worth anything if EVERY command
 * applies them. The v2.1.5 audit found the opposite: some commands disclosed, their
 * siblings silently answered over the same defect. This test is the CLAUDE.md
 * MCP↔CLI parity doctrine applied inside the CLI: it enumerates every command taking
 * `--base` (or reading the cached graph) and fails when one drops off the shared path.
 *
 * It is a SOURCE-level guard on purpose: a new `--base` command that forgets the
 * helper fails here, at authoring time, instead of shipping a silent fallback.
