/**
 * Fail-fast Node-version guard for the OpenLore CLI.
 *
 * Why this exists: OpenLore requires Node >=22.13, but OpenSpec requires only
 * >=20.19. When OpenLore runs as an OpenSpec plugin, a user on Node 20/21 can run
 * `openspec lore generate`, which spawns `openlore` under a Node OpenLore does not
 * support. `engines` in package.json is advisory at install time and does NOT
 * protect that spawn. So we check at runtime and, below the floor, write ONE
 * legible line to stderr (required + actual versions) and exit with a stable,
 * dedicated code — never a stack trace or a partial run — so the host propagates a
 * legible failure through its exit-code plumbing.
 *
 * This module is imported FIRST in src/cli/index.ts so it evaluates before
 * commander and the heavy command modules. Keep it dependency-free.

 * nodejs/node#55854). MUST stay in sync with package.json `engines.node` and
 * constants.ts's `MIN_NODE_*` (a test asserts all three). */
