/**
 * Pure pre-commit gate reason machine.
 * (change: harden-memory-integrity-invariant)
 *
 * The commit gate maps the current decision-store state to exactly one outcome:
 * either it passes, or it blocks with one of the canonical {@link GATE_REASONS}.
 * That mapping used to live inline in the CLI command, tangled with stdout, git,
 * and TTY I/O — impossible to prove total or deterministic. Extracting it as this
 * pure function makes the machine a tested contract:
 *
 *   - **total**     — every reachable state yields exactly one outcome;
 *   - **deterministic / idempotent** — same state ⇒ same outcome, every time;
 *   - **deadlock-free** — no state maps to "blocked with no actionable reason."
 *
 * The CLI gathers the booleans (store counts, consolidation recency, staged git
 * changes) and builds the user-facing payload; this function is the single
 * arbiter of *which* reason applies.
 */
