/**
 * Code-anchored memory — deterministic anchoring + freshness engine.
 * (change: add-code-anchored-memory-staleness)
 *
 * A persisted memory (an architectural decision or a `remember` note) is bound to
 * the code it describes by one or more {@link StructuralAnchor}s. At recall time
 * a freshness verdict is computed against the *current* call graph using only
 * boolean inputs — symbol existence and content-hash equality — with no tunable
 * threshold and no weighted score. This is what lets recall be bullet-proof: a
 * memory whose anchored code moved or died is labeled, never served silently.
 *
 * This module is intentionally pure: it operates on a minimal node view and a
 * {@link GraphFreshnessView} of lookups, so the resolution/verdict logic is unit
 * tested without touching disk or the edge store. The disk-backed adapter that
 * supplies the views lives in `anchor-adapter.ts`.
