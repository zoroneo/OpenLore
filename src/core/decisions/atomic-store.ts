/**
 * Durable, concurrency-safe persistence primitives for the JSON stores.
 * (change: harden-memory-integrity-invariant)
 *
 * OpenLore's promise — *never serve an unverified or stale fact as
 * authoritative* — is only as strong as the durability of the files behind it.
 * Both stores (`.openlore/memory/notes.json`, `.openlore/decisions/pending.json`)
 * are single JSON files rewritten in full. Without these primitives:
 *
 *   - a crash mid-write leaves a torn file that loads as a silent empty store
 *     (memory vanishes, nothing says so), and
 *   - two concurrent writers race: last-writer-wins silently drops the other.
 *
 * This module supplies three stdlib-only primitives (no new dependency, no LLM):
 *
 *   1. {@link atomicWriteFile} — write to a temp file, fsync, then POSIX-rename
 *      into place. A crash before the rename leaves the prior store intact.
 *   2. {@link casUpdate} — optimistic compare-and-swap on a monotonic `sequence`:
 *      load → mutate → commit only if the on-disk sequence is unchanged; on a
 *      conflict, re-read and re-apply the (append/supersede) merge rather than
 *      clobber. No concurrent write is lost.
 *   3. {@link quarantineCorrupt} — move a store that fails validation aside to
 *      `*.corrupt-<n>` and signal it, instead of silently substituting empty.

 * orders writes, names quarantine files, and lets external readers detect change),
 * but correctness no longer depends on every writer honoring it.
 *
 * `mutate` MUST be a pure merge over the loaded store (append / id-keyed
 * upsert / supersede) so that applying it to the latest store is always correct.
 * ALL writers of a given store MUST go through this function (or a wrapper of it)
