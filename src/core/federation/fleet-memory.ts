/**
 * Fleet-level anchored memory (ADR-0019; federation group 4 + cross-agent intent
 * handoff, item 3). The intersection of federation and bitemporal anchored memory:
 * a memory recorded in a producer repo and anchored to an interface it publishes
 * surfaces, with its freshness verdict, when an agent recalls while editing a
 * consumer repo.
 *
 * Direction: the HOME repo (where recall runs) is the consumer. Its external call
 * references (`confidence === 'external'`) name the upstream interfaces it uses.
 * For each scoped producer repo we load its index + memory store ONCE, select the
 * memories anchored to one of those interfaces, and compute each memory's freshness
 * against the PRODUCER's graph — so the authoritative-recall invariant holds across
 * the boundary (an orphaned producer anchor is withheld, exactly as in-repo).
 *
 * Deterministic, no LLM, no merged graph (each repo loaded lazily). Cross-repo
 * identity is name-only — arity/overload is unavailable at an external call site,
 * the same honest caveat the rest of federation carries.
