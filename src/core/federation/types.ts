/**
 * Multi-repo federation — shared types.
 *
 * Federation is an *index-of-indexes*: each repository keeps its own
 * independently-built `.openlore/` index, and a small project-local registry
 * (`.openlore/federation.json`) references those indexes by path, fingerprint and
 * schema version. No merged cross-repo graph is ever materialized; federated
 * queries load only the per-repo indexes they need, on demand.
 *
 * See: openspec/changes/add-multi-repo-federation and decisions bf5aff2d (registry
 * schema) + 67ca60fe (cross-repo resolution contract).
