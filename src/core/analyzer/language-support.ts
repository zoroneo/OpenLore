/**
 * Declarative language-support registry (change: add-declarative-language-support-registry).
 *
 * Consolidates the per-language capability knowledge OpenLore already encodes — scattered
 * across the call-graph extractor, the CFG `SPECS` table, the signature extractor, the
 * type-inference engine, and the IaC projector — behind one declarative, queryable
 * registry, and makes per-language coverage an observable fact.
 *
 * Faithfulness is the whole point: an over-claimed coverage matrix is worse than none. So
 * this registry is DERIVED, not hand-listed — each capability flag is computed from the
 * SAME authoritative structure the corresponding extractor consults at run time:
 *   - `signatures`     ← {@link SIGNATURE_LANGUAGES}        (signature-extractor.ts)
 *   - `callGraph`      ← {@link CALLGRAPH_LANGUAGES}        (call-graph.ts)
 *   - `imports`        ← {@link IMPORT_RESOLUTION_LANGUAGES} (import-resolver-bridge.ts)
 *   - `cfgOverlay`     ← {@link cfgSupportsLanguage}        (cfg.ts)
 *   - `typeInference`  ← {@link TYPE_INFERENCE_LANGUAGES}   (type-inference-engine.ts)
 *   - `iacProjection`  ← {@link isIacLanguage}              (iac/types.ts)
 *   - `styleFingerprint`← {@link STYLE_FINGERPRINT_LANGUAGES} (style-fingerprint.ts)
 * A behavioral test (`language-support.test.ts`) cross-checks each flag against the live
 * extractor on a fixture, so the registry cannot silently drift from reality.
 *
 * Fail-soft is a uniform contract: a language with no record — or a record that does not
 * back a capability — yields nothing for that capability, never an error or a guess. This
 * change does NOT alter extraction output for any language; it only organizes and exposes
 * support that already exists.
 *
 * Deterministic, no LLM, no graph-schema change.
