/**
 * MCP handler: working_set_context (change: add-working-set-context-briefing).
 *
 * Second of three in SPEC-STORE-INTEGRATION.md. Given a configured spec-store
 * binding (add-spec-store-binding) and an active change, this assembles ONE
 * deterministic, token-budgeted structural briefing spanning the change's target
 * repositories — `orient`, generalized from a single repo to the change's targets.
 *
 * It composes existing pieces only and adds NO new relevance model and NO LLM
 * (north star `c6d1ad07`):
 *   - `handleSpecStoreStatus` resolves + health-checks the binding (the single
 *     source of truth for which targets are briefable);
 *   - `handleOrient` runs task-scoped orientation against each indexed target,
 *     keyed on the change's extracted intent;
 *   - anchored-intent freshness is free: orient's `pendingDecisions` are the in-scope
 *     authoritative decisions each carrying a freshness verdict, with orphaned anchors
 *     already excluded — so the briefing flags drifted intent and withholds orphaned
 *     by construction;
 *   - the merged briefing is ranked by orient's score and bounded with the shared
 *     `applyTokenBudget` / `omissionNote` helpers (add-trust-calibrated-context-economy).
 *
 * Read-only and conclusion-shaped: it returns a briefing an agent reads in full
 * (per-target attributed items + named intent), never a raw graph. It never throws
 * for a binding/change/index problem — every problem degrades to a finding.
