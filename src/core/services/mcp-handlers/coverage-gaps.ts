/**
 * Structural Test-Coverage Gap Report (change: add-test-coverage-gap-report) —
 * deterministic, graph-derived, no runtime.
 *
 * `select_tests` answers the FORWARD question — "I changed X, which tests reach
 * it?" — by walking the call graph backward from a change to the tests. This is
 * the exact INVERSE, run once over the whole graph: the set of production
 * functions in the backward-reachable set of NO test — i.e. no test transitively
 * reaches them — is the structurally-untested surface. Inverting the same
 * reachability that powers test selection yields coverage gaps for free, with no
 * test execution, no coverage instrumentation, and no working runtime.
 *
 * SOUNDNESS — gaps only, never "tested". A symbol with no reaching test
 * definitely has a coverage gap (the falsifiable, sound direction). The report
 * NEVER makes the unsound inverse claim that a symbol WITH a reaching test is
 * "tested": structural reachability from a test means a test CAN reach the code,
 * not that the test ASSERTS its behavior. Ranking reuses the existing
 * `landmark-signals` hub/chokepoint labels (no composite score, no new tuning
 * constant), so untested load-bearing code floats to the top.
 *
 * Distinct from `find_dead_code`: a gap node with no caller at all is ALSO dead
 * (find_dead_code's domain) and is labeled as such; an untested entry point or
 * framework-invoked handler is a real gap and is reported, labeled
 * untested-not-dead — the two conclusions stay separate.
 *
 * Distinct from `get_test_coverage`: that is a spec/domain tag-based report from
 * the test-generator; this is pure call-graph structural reachability.
