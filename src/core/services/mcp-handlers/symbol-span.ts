/**
 * `locate_symbol_span` MCP handler (change: add-symbol-span-locator).
 *
 * The read-only, staleness-checked edit LOCATION an agent can trust. OpenLore
 * already resolves a task to a precise symbol (`suggest_insertion_points` names
 * the function; tree-sitter gives byte-exact spans; `find_clones`-style
 * `name::path` addressing disambiguates). But when the agent goes to APPLY an
 * edit, it re-locates that span by string-matching a fresh read — the one step
 * where the substrate's knowledge is thrown away and replaced by guesswork
 * (wrong-overload hits, duplicated snippets, whitespace drift), with no signal
 * that the index it is trusting is even current.
 *
 * This tool closes that gap without giving OpenLore a write face: it returns the
 * indexed symbol's span (byte + line) plus a freshness VERDICT, and the host
 * applies the edit with its own tool. It adds precision and a freshness
 * guarantee, not write authority.
 *
 * Freshness (fail-safe toward distrust, matching `FreshnessFailsSafeTowardDistrust`):
 *   - `fresh`  — the substrate can vouch that the recorded offsets still point at
 *                the indexed symbol: either the file's content hash still matches
 *                the hash the index recorded (authoritative), or — when the full
 *                analyze recorded no per-file hash — the file has not been written
 *                since the index artifact was produced.
 *   - `stale`  — the file changed since analysis (content hash differs, or it was
 *                written after the index). The offsets are NOT trustworthy; the
 *                tool returns a re-analyze hint instead of a location.
 *   - `ambiguous` / `not-found` — a bare name matching several / no symbols → the
 *                `name::path` candidate list, never a fuzzy guess.
 *
 * Computed live from the cached call graph + a re-read of the one file the symbol
 * spans (no new persisted artifact). Read-only: the handler never writes, moves,
 * or deletes any file.
