/**
 * `get_language_support` — the queryable coverage answer for the declarative
 * language-support registry (change: add-declarative-language-support-registry).
 *
 * Turns "is language L supported, and for what?" from tribal knowledge into a
 * conclusion-shaped, honest answer. With a named `language` it is a pure registry
 * lookup (fail-soft: an unknown language returns an all-unsupported record, never an
 * error). With no language it reports the coverage matrix for the repo's DETECTED
 * languages, so a quiet result elsewhere is interpretable ("calls unsupported for L"
 * vs. "no callers"). Read-only, deterministic, opt-in. No LLM.
