/**
 * MCP handler: change_impact_certificate (change: add-change-impact-certificate).
 *
 * Third of three in SPEC-STORE-INTEGRATION.md. For a proposed change (the working
 * tree vs a base ref), emit ONE deterministic, conclusion-shaped impact
 * certificate: the change's blast radius (reused from `blast_radius`), the paths it
 * NEWLY OPENS into each declared covering surface, the specs it drifts, and the
 * tests to run. The certificate is anchored to the touched symbols via the existing
 * code-anchored freshness lease, so it decays: when the change grows or an anchored
 * symbol moves, a re-check reports it stale and it is never presented as current.
 *
 * The novel piece is newly-opened-path detection, computed DIFFERENTIALLY without
 * any full-repo rebuild and without the (still-unbuilt) incremental dependency
 * graph: a new call edge can only originate from a changed file, so we re-parse
 * ONLY the changed files at the base ref and at the working tree (the exact bounded
 * primitive `structural_diff` uses), take each changed caller's added/removed callee
 * names, resolve them to canonical node ids by unique-name match, and adjust the
 * canonical adjacency both ways: post = canonical + added − removed, pre = canonical
 * − added + removed. That normalization is correct regardless of index staleness,
 * because unchanged-file edges are invariant and the changed-file deltas are
 * authoritative. A node that can reach a surface in `post` but not in `pre` is
 * newly able to reach it — the path the change opened.
 *
 * Deterministic, no LLM (north star `c6d1ad07`). Read-only and conclusion-shaped:
 * the result is a briefing an owner acts on — named surfaces, named shortest paths,
 * counts — never a raw graph. It never throws for an infrastructure problem; every
 * problem degrades to a finding or a caveat, and the certificate is advisory.
