/**
 * Unified finding-enforcement policy (change: add-finding-enforcement-policy).
 *
 * OpenLore emits governance findings from several deterministic sources — the
 * pre-flight blast-radius guard, the change-impact certificate, and (this change)
 * the stale-decision-reference check. Each had grown its OWN config for "should
 * this block a commit or merely inform?" (`blastRadius.block`,
 * `impactCertificate.block`), so an operator had to learn N enforcement stories.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth. It decouples two things that should
 * be separate:
 *   - a finding's *intrinsic severity* — a property of the finding, owned by the
 *     source that computes it (never altered here);
 *   - its *enforcement class* — whether THIS repository wants it to block, owned
 *     by `.openlore/config.json` `enforcement.policy` (a `code → class` map).
 *
 * Resolution is a pure, order-independent function with a fixed precedence:
 *   explicit `off` > explicit `blocking` > explicit `advisory` > source default.
 * `advisory` is the source default for every code, so a repository that declares
 * no policy behaves exactly as it does today. Deterministic, no LLM (north star
 * `c6d1ad07`).
