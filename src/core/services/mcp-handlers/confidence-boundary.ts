/**
 * Confidence-boundary disclosure (change: add-confidence-boundary-disclosure).
 *
 * Every conclusion answer carries a deterministic `confidenceBoundary` saying what
 * it does NOT know: how much of the traversal rested on directly-resolved edges vs
 * synthesized (heuristic) ones, which known-unknowable boundaries it crossed, and
 * whether the index it ran against still matches the working tree. Categorical
 * labels and counts only — never a blended confidence score, never an LLM call
 * (north star c6d1ad07). Additive metadata: a caller that ignores it sees today's
 * answer unchanged.
 *
 * The basis and crossings are derived from the `confidence`/`synthesizedBy`
 * provenance already on every edge (spec: add-synthesized-dynamic-dispatch-edges,
 * add-type-hierarchy-resolved-dispatch). The staleness marker reuses the project
 * fingerprint written at analyze time and the git diff machinery — nothing new is
 * computed at analyze time except the optional build commit.
