/**
 * `map_in_flight_conflicts` — the cross-actor interference map (change:
 * add-cross-actor-interference-map, PARALLEL-WORK-COORDINATION proposal 4, the
 * team wedge).
 *
 * Generalizes `plan_parallel_work` (proposal 2) from "N agent tasks I am about to
 * dispatch" to "every change in flight right now" — local branches, open pull
 * requests, and caller-supplied agent task descriptors alike, within and across a
 * federation of repos. Each in-flight change becomes an actor-attributed node whose
 * footprint (proposal 1) is derived from its ACTUAL diff, and the same pairwise
 * hazard classifier (proposal 1) runs across all nodes. The output is a conclusion:
 * per change, the other in-flight changes it conflicts with, the hazard class, the
 * witnessing symbols, and a suggested landing order.
 *
 * Design invariants (mirror the proposal's Decision + Scope contract):
 * - **Read-only, stateless, no new graph.** A pure function of current git state +
 *   the indexed graphs at call time. No watcher, no poll, no persisted conflict
 *   store, no new node/edge schema — footprints ride existing primitives.
 * - **Observed, not declared.** A change's write-set comes from mapping its diff
 *   hunks onto the enclosing symbols of the BASE snapshot, with a per-symbol
 *   `writeMode` read off the diff itself: a symbol touched only by pure-insertion
 *   hunks is an `append`, one touched by any deletion/modification is a `modify`.
 *   This makes registry-collision resolution automatic — two PRs that each append a
 *   disjoint entry to the same dispatcher resolve to `shared-append`, not a WAW, with
 *   no `writeMode` declaration needed (the diffs are observable).
 * - **Honest about what it cannot see.** A PR whose diff cannot be fetched, a target
 *   repo whose index is stale/missing, or a change whose symbols do not resolve is a
 *   clearly-labeled "not assessed" node — NEVER a false "no conflict".
 * - **Advisory by default.** WAW conflicts are emitted as policy-shaped
 *   `GovernanceFinding`s (`cross-actor-conflict`) so a caller/CI can classify them
 *   with `resolveEnforcementClass` and choose to block; this tool blocks nothing.
 * - **Degrades to single-repo.** Federation is opt-in; with none configured the map
 *   covers this repo's own branches, local PRs, and supplied descriptors.
