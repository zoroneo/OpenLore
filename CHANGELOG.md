# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenLore are documented here. This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Task-scoped context injection** — `openlore install` now wires a Claude Code
  `UserPromptSubmit` hook running `openlore orient --inject`, which orients on your
  submitted prompt and injects a bounded, deterministic, ignorable orientation
  block *before the agent's first turn* — amortizing the per-task `orient`
  round-trip the Value Scorecard attributes the small/familiar loss case to. A
  deterministic relevance gate keeps it out of weak/shallow tasks (degrading to a
  one-line pointer); it is fail-open (never breaks a turn) and reuses the lean
  `orient` output (no new MCP tool). Disable or tune via the `contextInjection`
  block in `.openlore/config.json` (`mode: "off"`, `tokenBudget`, gate thresholds).
  Adapters without a pre-turn hook (Cursor/Cline/Continue/AGENTS.md) fall back to
  the instruction block (#184).

## [2.1.3] - 2026-06-22

Everything merged since v2.1.2: a batch of new agent-facing capabilities plus a
deep end-to-end hardening and dogfooding pass. The version is read from
`package.json`, so the CLI and the MCP server both report `2.1.3`.

### Added

- **Agent behavioral governance ("panic")** — opt-in, off by default (#175). A
  PreToolUse destabilization guard (`openlore panic-check`), an observe→memory
  feedback loop that feeds behavioral hotspots into `orient`, an optional Gryph
  runtime observer, and an accuracy-validation harness
  (`panic-validate` / `panic-calibrate` / `panic-replay`). Enable per project with
  `openlore setup --panic <mode>` and install the hooks with
  `openlore setup --hooks <format>` (remove them with `--hooks none`).
- **External spec-store binding** — the `spec_store_status` MCP tool (federation
  preset) reports the read-only health of a `.openlore/config.json` `specStore`
  binding and its indexed targets (#178).
- **Working-set context briefing** — the `working_set_context` MCP tool assembles
  one token-budgeted, per-target structural briefing for an active change across
  its spec-store targets (#180).
- **Change-impact certificate** — the `change_impact_certificate` MCP tool and the
  `openlore impact-certificate` CLI certify what a diff touches: the paths it
  newly opens into declared covering surfaces (differential, no LLM), blast
  radius, drifted specs, and the tests to run (#181).
- **Live dependency graph in watch mode** — `watch` now reconciles file creates &
  deletes and keeps `dependency-graph.json` import edges (including inline
  `<script>` and HTML asset edges) fresh incrementally (#173).
- **Pi extension** — marketplace gallery preview image (#174); Windows daemon
  hardening so no console window flashes (#177).

### Changed

- Removed the `get_decisions` MCP tool. ADRs are now surfaced through
  `search_specs` (domain `decisions`) and via `orient`'s ADR matches, which now
  work without an embedding server (#179).
- `.mjs` / `.cjs` / `.mts` / `.cts` files are now recognized as JavaScript /
  TypeScript and included in the call graph and signature index (previously
  silently dropped).
- Panic-state: the on-disk file is the single source of truth for the
  cross-process intervention counter; all writers (MCP server, hook, daemon)
  serialize through one lock.
- Documentation: Windows setup steps in CONTRIBUTING (#176); corrected and guarded
  MCP tool-count references.

### Fixed

End-to-end hardening pass (PR #182), all with regression tests:

- **First run** — `openlore init` and `openlore run` now create `.gitignore` on a
  fresh `git init` repo, so `.openlore/` analysis artifacts (multi-MB lance
  binaries) aren't accidentally committed and don't pollute diff-based tools.
- **MCP no-throw / robustness** — `get_spec` confines its `domain` argument
  (path-traversal fix); `get_file_dependencies` guards a partial dependency-graph
  artifact; `change_impact_certificate` drops non-object surface members and
  `buildLeaseAnchors` never escapes the handler; a malformed `callGraph` is
  normalized instead of crashing graph handlers; large tool results stay valid
  JSON when capped to the byte budget.
- **LLM generation** — all providers tolerate malformed or `usage`-less responses
  (common with OpenAI-compatible gateways) instead of crashing or reporting `$NaN`
  cost.
- **Panic** — fixed a cross-process lost-update on the intervention counter;
  untrusted `panic-state.json` fields are sanitized and a NaN timestamp is treated
  as expired; panic hooks gained an uninstall path and update in place on a format
  change.
- **Multi-repo federation** — a registered repo that throws mid-query is skipped
  with a reason instead of aborting the whole fleet query; tool output no longer
  leaks absolute host paths.
- **CLI** — `verify --json` and `decisions --sync` now exit non-zero on failure
  (they previously reported failure but exited 0, defeating CI gates); `decisions`
  has a top-level error boundary; `openlore view` reports a friendly message on a
  port-in-use, sanitizes errors before logging, and serves a 404 (not 500) for a
  missing graph artifact.
